        Twitter Inc said on Wednesday it is testing a new feature that will allow users to tweet using their voice,
        capturing up to 140 seconds of audio in a single tweet. The feature will be available to a limited number of
        users on Apple’s iOS platform for now and be rolled out for more iOS users in the coming weeks, Twitter said in
        a blog post.

        The micro-blogging platform said users will be able to create a voice tweet using a new “wavelengths” icon on
        the Tweet composer screen. Social media companies, including Twitter, have long been under pressure to curb
        content such as abuse, harassment and misinformation on their platforms. During the inquiry, the hospital
        contended the government resolution (GR) capping the prices for COVID-19 treatment, reserving 20% beds and
        offering free treatment for the poor, came into effect on April 30 and May 21 respectively, which was after the
        patients were discharged. Last week, the seven residents had approached the high court alleging that the
        hospital had charged them ₹12.5 lakh for treatment and had threatened to stop their discharge if they failed to
        pay the money. In their plea filed through advocate Vivek Shukla, the petitioners had sought a refund saying
        that the hospital was bound to reserve beds for the poor and provide them free treatment since it was run by a
        charitable trust.
